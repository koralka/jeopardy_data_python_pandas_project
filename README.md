# üèÜ Jeopardy Data Analysis Project #
## :pushpin: Project Description ##
This project explores a dataset of **Jeopardy questions** to identify patterns, trends, and relationships between different aspects of the game. The dataset contains historical Jeopardy questions, their respective categories, monetary values, and answers.

This project is **my first attempt at working with a dataset using pandas**. 
It is part of Codecademy‚Äôs Data Science learning pathway, designed to help me practice data cleaning, filtering, and basic analysis.

## :bar_chart: Dataset Information ##
The dataset includes the following columns:
- **Air Date** ‚Äì The date the question aired  
- **Round** ‚Äì The game round (Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy!, Final Jeopardy!)  
- **Category** ‚Äì The category of the question  
- **Value** ‚Äì The monetary value assigned to the question  
- **Question** ‚Äì The question text  
- **Answer** ‚Äì The correct response

## :dart: Project Goals ##
Since this project is primarily for **practice and skill development**, I focused on the following:  
‚úî Filtering the dataset to find questions containing specific words  
‚úî Converting monetary values into numerical data  
‚úî Investigating how question topics have changed over time  
‚úî Identifying the most common categories in each round  


## :hammer_and_wrench: How the Code Works ##
### :one:  Data Cleaning ###
- Renamed columns for consistency  
- Converted the "Value" column to a float for analysis  
- Extracted "Year" from the "Air Date" column  

### :two: Data Filtering & Analysis
- **Filtered questions** based on specific keywords (e.g., "King", "Computer")  
- **Calculated the average monetary value** of filtered questions  
- **Counted unique answers** to questions containing specific words  
- **Investigated category frequency** across Jeopardy rounds  
- **Compared question trends over time** (e.g., questions from the 90s vs. 2000s)


## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Key Findings ##
- The most frequent **Jeopardy!** category is **"BEFORE & AFTER"** in **Double Jeopardy!**  
- **Literature and Science** appear **far more often in Double Jeopardy!** than in Jeopardy!  
-  The word **"Computer" appeared more frequently in the 2000s than in the 1990s**  
- **"Stupid Answers"** is one of the most common categories in Jeopardy!

## :rocket: Future Improvements ##
As this is a **learning-focused project**, I plan to improve it by:
- Expanding the analysis to explore more question patterns  
- Introducing **data visualisations** (e.g., bar charts) to illustrate trends  
- Experimenting with more complex data analysis techniques
